  <p>
    What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?
    I was very new to all of these languages before I took the class except Javascript, which I used when I took the class AP Computer Science Principles during my sophomore year of high school.
    Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?
    I used the template that you gave your students during the midterm, which was very helpful as the css helped align all of text and design my webpage in a user-friendly way.
    What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)
    The most challenging part of my portfolio was getting all of the pages to work cohesively, such as all of the links working and getting to the right page.
    How taking this class changed your view on Web Development?
    Yes. Taking this class has greatly changed my view on Web Development because I now understand how useful learning Web Development in the real world can be. 
    What would you recommend to future students taking this class?
    I would recommend to use online resources to your advantage such as w3schools and tutorialspoint as they are super helpful/useful in learning, understanding, and applying the material to assignments in the class.
